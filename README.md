# WEB103 Prework - CreatorVerse

Submitted by: Rodela Ghosh

About this web app: 
CreatorVerse is a React web application that allows users to explore, save, and manage their favorite content creators. Users can browse a list of featured creators, add or remove them to their personal collection, and view detailed pages for each creator. The app supports search by name, category, or description, and allows full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Built with Supabase as a backend and styled with Tailwind CSS, CreatorVerse offers a smooth, responsive, and interactive user experience.

Time spent: 20 hours

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

Building this app was a rewarding learning experience. Some of the key challenges I encountered included:

Learning Supabase: It was my first time integrating a backend-as-a-service platform like Supabase. Setting up tables, handling permissions, and managing async API calls took some experimentation.

State Management: Keeping the UI in sync with the database, especially when adding/removing creators, required careful use of useEffect and useState.

Deploying with Render: Understanding how to configure build and publish settings (especially the frontend/ root directory and dist folder from Vite) was initially confusing, but I learned how to troubleshoot build logs and fix directory structure issues.
